# Purpose

Life values are important to everyone. Clearly understanding your life values will help you make appropriate choices in your life. However, how to do it? is a question that everyone wants to know. Therefore, a tool is developed, which asks people several questions to identify people's life values. This tool has been commonly used across the world. 

To make the tool easily used, I created this project to execute this tool by codes.

To realize this tool, the project takes references from [this website](https://www.lifedesigners.org/post/%E8%AE%93%E6%88%91%E5%80%91%E6%B4%BB%E7%9A%84%E6%9B%B4%E5%BF%AB%E6%A8%82%E7%9A%84%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC%E8%A7%80%E6%8E%A2%E7%B4%A2). This website mentions the whole process to realize the tool. However, it may lead to conflicts in orders. Therefore, the project orders life values by the times of life values selected by users or by users themselves.

# How to use the tool?
1. Download `main.exe` in the path of `src/dist`
2. Execute `main.exe` on your computer
3. Based on the instructions, answer questions. It may take some time to finish all questions.

# The project still has a long path to become better
## TODO
1. add timeout: 3 seconds
2. become more elastic, can use other values 
3. add break option => users can restart specific question
4. change the font of words
5. add the check of life values input
6. may connect to Notion to store results
7. add a small video in README

<br />

## Issue
1. revise similarity based on orders
2. speed the execution time of .exe
